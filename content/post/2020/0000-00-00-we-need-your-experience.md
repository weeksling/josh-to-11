*I’m beginner, I’m intermediate, and I’m advanced.*   
*I’m an expert and a novice.*  
*I’m a teacher and a student.*

Can all of these things exist at the same time?

## Who Am I?

The majority of my career in technology was spent as a freelancer. When you're on your own, your main concern is keeping the pipeline full as far ahead as you can to ensure things like food and electricity remain a part of your life.

A big part of this exhausting hustle is writing about yourself. What  you have done (or have been involved with), what you can do (or learn quickly), how you work (or how you want people to think you work). You're selling yourself, which means you're highlighting the best parts and skipping over the rest.

I’ve been thinking about experience a lot lately. What experience I have and how I've gotten it, what I'm missing and how I can get it. 

For much of my professional career, I’ve had to do a lot of reading, writing about, and review of my professional history, my current skill set, and where I want to go. I’ve spent many hours writing about my work, something I find both fun and difficult. I’ve also been getting my resume in shape since it’s been 3 years since I touched it and, even then, it was woefully incomplete. On top of that, I’ve been reaching out to people to meet and talk, whether I though something tangible would come out of it or not.

All of this activity has made me more informed about what I’ve done and what I think I’m capable of than I have been in a long time. **This can be a very dangerous place to be for some.**

- We talk a lot about experience but we usually talk in terms of "more === better"
- A title of "Senior Engineer," regardless of other qualifications, always has some idea of "longer experience than others"
- This title typically comes with additional pay so we can draw a line from "more experience" to "more value in the organization"
