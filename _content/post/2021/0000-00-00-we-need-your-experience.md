## What I want to say

- More experience is not always better (think: higher title -> higher pay)
- We need people at all experience levels; don't let your level stop you
- Regardless of your level, occasionally invoke another level
- We often envy those with more, pity those with less
- We often see the additional knowledge but miss the additional biases
- We seem to only concentrate way down the path. We want to get there and know all the things and be able to do all of the stuff.
- Beginner's mind can be invoked or forced
- As someone just getting started down a path, you have a perspective on the road ahead and the world around you and what it took to take even a first step that you will lose, forever, as you continue down that road.

- *I’m beginner, I’m intermediate, and I’m advanced.*
- *I’m an expert and a novice.*
- *I’m a teacher and a student.*

Could all these things be true at the same time?

The majority of my career in technology was spent as a freelancer. When you're on your own, your main concern is keeping the pipeline full as far ahead as you can to ensure things like food and electricity remain an integral part of your life.

A big part of this exhausting hustle is writing about yourself. What you have done (or have been involved with), what you can do (or can learn quickly), how you work (or how you want people to think you work). You're selling yourself, which means you're highlighting the best parts and skipping over the rest.

Some people do this kind of thing naturally and some people hate it so much that updating their resume is just barely preferable to remaining unemployed for the rest of their life. I'm more in the former camp than the latter, but it's 60/40 at best. 

The hardest part is not finding the words or filtering the right attributes, **it's facing up to the experience level that I'm currently at.**
